# CPP-Findmax-Function-Templated
This program uses a function called findmax to find the maximum value in a 5 member array. This function is used to find the maximum value of each line of an input file and
writes the output as an array of only maximum integers with the same amount of lines as the input file. It differs from the first findmax-function program in that this version
is templated
